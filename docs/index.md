# Exploring 2023 NYC Taxi Ride Patterns

## **Project Overview**
Ride-hailing services, including For-Hire Vehicles (FHVs) like taxis, have become an integral part of urban transportation in large cities such as New York. With the city's unpredictable weather patterns, there is growing interest in understanding how external factors, such as weather conditions, influence ride-hailing demand. In a previous analysis of the [2023 NYC Taxi Dataset](https://weij5678.github.io/NYC-Taxi/), it was found that tipping percentage had a weak association with trip characteristics, while trip characteristics showed little to no association with weather conditions, as revealed through PCA and canonical correlation analysis. Building on these findings, the motivation for this final project is to further explore this dataset to examine FHV ride patterns and analyze how weather conditions may affect commuters based on the time of day.

- **Dataset**: [NYC FHV Trip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2023-High-Volume-FHV-Trip-Data/u253-aew4/about_data)
- **Tools Used**: R 
- **Statistical Methods**: Hiearchical Clustering and Confirmatory Analysis


### **Key Research Questions**:
- How does tipping behavior, trip characteristics, and weather differ during rush hour(morning) compared to non-rush hour(noon)?
- Can we identify distinct groups/cluster of riders based on their tipping habits and trip patterns/weather?
